# Scripts

This repo contains scripts written by me for simplifying my life.

---

- [firewall](firewall.sh) - This is a shell script for automatically setting up the firewall on my laptop. Pretty basic stuff using ufw, nothing too fancy!
- [Firefox - user.js](Firefox-Config/user.js) - This is a culmination of Betterfox and Arkenfox, which configure Firefox and other Firefox-based browsers to enhance security and performance. The result is a clean, distraction-free browsing experience that minimizes the risk of site breakage.
